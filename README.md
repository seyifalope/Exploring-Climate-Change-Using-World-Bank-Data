# Statistics-and-Trends
This project aims to investigate climate change using data obtained from the World Bank. Seven countries across different continents were selected, and the relationship between the following factors on climate change were studied: CO2 emissions (kt), urban population, electric power consumption (kWh per capita), and forest land (% of land area).The analysis of the factors contributing to climate change revealed that there are some relationships between these factors in emerging 
countries such as Brazil, China, and India. Statistical functions were applied to get further insights from the data
