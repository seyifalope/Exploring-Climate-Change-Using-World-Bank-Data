# Exploring Climate Change: A Multi-Factor Analysis Across Seven Countries Using World Bank Data
This project focuses on investigating climate 
change using data obtained from world bank. 7 
countries across various continents were selected 
and the relationship of the following factors: Co2 
emission (kt), Urban population, Electric power 
consumption (kWh per capita) and Forest land (% 
of land area) on climate change were 
investigated. The examination of causes behind 
climate change revealed some relationship 
between the factors of study for emerging 
countries such as Brazil, China and India
